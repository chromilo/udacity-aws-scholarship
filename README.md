# udacity_aws_scholarship

These are my notes for the 3 month challenge on AWS Machine Learning course. The format of the daily check-ins must follow this format:

What did I work on yesterday?  
What will I work on today?  
What issues are blocking my progress?

Day 1:
1.  Yesterday and the days before this, I finished up to AWS MLE lesson 2.5.
2.  Today I finished AWS MLE lesson 2.8. 
3.  No blockers.
